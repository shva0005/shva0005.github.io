        <article>
            Hello, my name is Kevin and I'm 22 years old. I go to school on the weekdays and work on weekends which so far I have been able to manage better than I had anticapated. I play video games when I'm bored at home, but not as much anymore since my favourite game <q>Paladins: Champions of the realm</q> which I have over 4000 hours in and became one of the best players in has stopped development due to the horrible decisions made by the company.
         <br>
            Honestly I moved here from a town called Newmarket just 30 minutes north of Toronto a year go and haven't made any friends until I met my classmates which I'm very grateful to have now. We went to the Wolves Den and ate together, and even started going to the gym with eachother.
