        <h2>About me</h2>
        <article>
            <p>Hello, my name is Kevin and I'm 22 years old. I go to school on the weekdays and work on weekends which so far I have been able to manage better than I had anticapated. I play video games when I'm bored at home, but not as much anymore since my favourite game <q>Paladins: Champions of the realm</q> which I have over 4000 hours in and peaked 89<sup>th</sup> in the world but the game has since stopped development due to the horrible decisions by the company and developers.</p>
<br>
            <p>Honestly I moved here from a town called Newmarket just 30 minutes north of Toronto a year go and haven't made any friends until I met my classmates which I'm very grateful to have now. We went to the Wolves Den and ate together, and even started going to the gym with eachother.</p>
